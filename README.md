# ALX System Engineering and DevOps - Bash, Scripting, Web Stack/Web Stack Debugging, Networking & Security, CI/CD
This repository contains programs written for the system engineering and DevOps track. In these projects, I worked with Bash and practiced writing Bash scripts to
automate tasks. I learned about the OSI model and various Linux networking tools. Further, I configured a distributed system - two web servers and one load balancer - 
for deployment of my AirBnB project using Nginx, HAProxy, certbot, ufw, and MySQL. The specific list of projects contained follows:
